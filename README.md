### Welcome to Golang, Baby Gopher!

To become a Gopher, first you are a Baby Gopher. 

"The young are born blind and helpless" - [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(animal)#Pocket_gopher)

Write some Golang, share a library, share a project. Tell the world that you are new and a Baby Gopher. Big Gophers will then happily help you with your code. Gophers nurture their young.
